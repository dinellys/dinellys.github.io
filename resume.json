        "summary": "Something I have learned through the years is: You can always teach someone how to do things, but you cannot force them to have a good attitude towards them. This is something I'm really good at: I can teach people and I can lead teams and get them to do a great job with outstanding attitude. Being a Psychologist with more than 10 years of experience in Human resources processes and BPO has given me with the knowledge in several processes in this area: employee retention strategies, organisational communication, disciplinary processes, social responsibility, massive hiring and legal background. All this time being exposed to the industry has provided me with strong leadership skills promoting team personal and professional growth and keeping high quality standards in performance. I really think this would be valuable in organisations now a days, we not only work with processes but with people who in turn (and ultimately) deliver results for companies and make them competitive in the market, so, this is what I would bring to the table: To make you better, to make us The Best! Outside work I love to spend time working on my personal development, taking self awareness courses, focusing in work with emotions and how to identify themâ€¦ my spare time is pretty much like yours for sure: going to the movies, music, walks with my pet, time with my family and having \"Friends\" on repeat on Netflix.",
